# Pizza-project

Website for a pizzeria.
* In this project I used html, css and native js language.
* Website has a breadcrumb, that tied to html classes, and edited to the height of the screen, taking into account the header.
* Added popup boxes to order buttons.
* Created filter to different products, that bindend to classes
* In the bottom side you can find the Yandex map, that has the pointer of the pizzeria.
